## About

This site is a landing page and resource for participants in our two-day workshop introducing R, the tidyverse and census public use microdata to analysts from the city of Portland and students/faculty/staff from Portland State University.

We hope this website can act as a continual resource for workshop participants or curious viewers who are just learning R or census microdata.

## The Host

The workshop was held at Portland State University and hosted by the [Population Research Center](https://www.pdx.edu/prc/home). We have nearly 2 dozen participants from multiple City of Portland departments (including but not limited to the [Bureau of Planning and Sustainability](https://www.portlandoregon.gov/bps/) and the [Portland Housing Bureau](https://www.portlandoregon.gov/phb/)) as well as analysts from multiple departments from the State of Oregon such as the [Oregon Office of Economic Analysis](https://www.oregon.gov/das/OEA/Pages/Index.aspx). Portland, in particular, is a hotbed of open source development and innovation and we at Portland State are happy to introduce R to a new set of analysts and users in the public sector in service to our university's mission to "Let Knowledge Serve the City."
