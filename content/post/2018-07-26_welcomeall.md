We are a little less than one week away from the workshop and I just wanted to welcome you in a brief blog post.

We have a busy schedule set up for the first two days but the structure is designed to be lead by **you**, the workshop participants. We are big believers in the importance of learning by doing and by starting simple and working our way up. While we have some lecture portions, we have planned these to be at a minimum and to be only for what we consider to be vital information you cannot glean from working. This includes going over R data types, different file types and the details about census microdata and its benefits and risks. 

As mentioned before, you should come to workshop with [R](https://www.r-project.org/), [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) downloaded. Additionally, once you've installed R and RStudio we would recommend that you install the [**tidyverse**](https://www.tidyverse.org/) packages per the instructions you've already received over email. Beyond the tidyverse packages, I would also recommend you install the package [**data.table**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/index.html), and if you are someone who performs a lot of spatial analysis, install the [**sf**](https://r-spatial.github.io/sf/) package (note the additional installation instructions because sf has some external dependencies). We will not be focusing on spatial analysis for this particular workshop but some demonstrations we will be showing include mapping and some spatial operations so the especially ambitious should install **sf** if they wish to follow along.

Again, if there are any questions of concerns please check the contact page to get into contact with one of the hosts.
